Finding a spot to park our bikes is not as easy as it sounds. Especially when you're biking to an unfamiliar place where you have no idea where the closest bike parking is. Bike-a-Spot marks all the bike parking nearby. If you're planning your next urban bike trip, looking for the right place to park you bike, Bike-a-Spot shows your bike parking around your destination. Actually it goes beyond that--we virtually take you to the area to inspect the parking spots on your phone before you reach there. Taking no chances.
