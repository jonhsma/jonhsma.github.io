<b><strong><font size="+5">Jonathan Ma</font></strong></b> 

I am a forth year graduate student pursuing a Ph.D. degree in physics at the University of California, Berkeley. I have been doing research on noval materials and I utilize the technique of Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy to interogate the electronic structure of materials. In the process of analyzing data analysis, I developed a strong interest in image analysis. 

Born in Sydney, Australia and raised in Hong Kong, I am currently residing in Berkeley, California.
